# C_programming
Some of my personal projects, written in C or C++.

1. intToEnglish.c asks the user to enter any integer number from 1-999,
it then will return that integer in english words. (123 = one hundred twenty three)

2.converter.c is a program that asks the user for an input and converts it into 
a different unit. User is able to choose their conversion units. 

Conversions supported:
kilometers and miles
litres and gallons 
hectares and acres
