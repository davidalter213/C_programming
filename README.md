# C_programming
Some of my personal projects, written in C or C++.

1. intToEnglish.c asks the user to enter any integer number from 1-999,
it then will return that integer in english words. (123 = one hundred twenty three)

2.converter.c is a program that asks the user for an input and converts it into 
a different unit. User is able to choose their conversion units. 

Conversions supported:
kilometers and miles,
litres and gallons,
hectares and acres,
kilograms and pounds

3. arrayOperations.c is a simple program that asks the user for an integer array of arbitrary length, and then perfroms some
basic operations such as printing the size in bytes, printing the array in reverse, and more.
